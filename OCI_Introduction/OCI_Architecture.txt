Region: localised geographic area made of one or more Avalibility Domain
Avalibility Domain: one or more fault tolerant data centres within a region, connected to each other via a low latency high bandwidth network
	- don't share physical infrasturcture (e.g. power, coooling, internal network), failure of one AD doesn't impact avilibity of others
fault Domain: grouping of hardware and infrastrucure within AD to provide anti-affinity (aka logical data centres)

How to choose a region:
	- low latency and highest performance, choose closest region to user
	- complies to data residency and compliance requirements
	 - service availbility, based on regional demand, regulatory compliance, resource avalibility etc

regions are made of at least 1 AD
OCI is hosted in multiple regions

Fault domains protect agains failutes within  OCI AD
Each fault domain should be made of 1 server and 1 DB node to maintaine high avaliblity of the application

Each AD has 3 fault domains for high availability
Fault domains act as logical data centres within AD
OCI regions - Localised geographical areas where data centres are located

AD - at least 1 data centre in a geion
AD dont share phical infrasture
OCI region is localise dgeogrphical area
